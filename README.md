# Maverick-Summer-Internship-Challenge
It's a multi-class supervised learning classification problem. 
This was a major project for the course "SIV895 Special Module On Intelligent Info. Processing" at IIT Delhi for Mtech CSE 2nd semester.
Different Machine Learning models are used for this problem, their performances are compared. 
Data preprocessing, parameters hyper tuning are also done to make the models perform better.
